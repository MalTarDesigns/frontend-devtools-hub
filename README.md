**AI-powered browser development tools providing visual performance insights beyond traditional chatbots**

Real-time heatmaps, automated monitoring, and browser integration for modern web development.

## 🚀 What Makes This "Beyond Chatbots"

While AI assistants can suggest code improvements, they **cannot**:
- ❌ Monitor live performance metrics on your actual UI
- ❌ Provide visual overlays directly on your running application
- ❌ Integrate with browser APIs for real-time analysis
- ❌ Show performance issues as they happen during user interaction

**Our tools bridge this gap** by providing:
- ✅ **Visual performance heatmaps** overlaid directly on web pages
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** using browser Performance APIs
- ✅ **Framework component detection** (React, Angular, Vue)
- ✅ **Automated insights** that no chatbot could replicate

## 🔥 Performance Heatmapper (Available Now)

Turn performance bottlenecks into visual insights with colored overlays and real-time metrics.

### Key Features
- **🎨 Color-coded overlays**: Green (fast) → Yellow (moderate) → Orange (slow) → Red (critical)
- **📊 Performance badges**: Shows actual timing data (e.g., "120ms", "45ms")
- **🎯 Framework detection**: Identifies React, Angular, and Vue components
- **⚡ Long Task monitoring**: Detects JavaScript operations > 50ms
- **🛡️ Safe operation**: Minimal performance impact on host websites

### Current Status: Demo Mode
- **Static demonstration** with safe colored overlays
- **Fake performance data** for visual concept validation
- **Crash-proof operation** - cannot impact website performance
- **Next phase**: Real Long Task API integration

## 📥 Quick Start

### Install the Browser Extension

1. **Download the extension**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MalTarDesigns/frontend-devtools-hub.git
   cd frontend-devtools-hub/extensions/performance-heatmapper
   ```

2. **Load in Chrome**:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `performance-heatmapper` folder

3. **Test it out**:
   - Visit any website (try `http://localhost:3001` for our demo site)
   - Click the 🔥 extension icon
   - Enable monitoring to see colored performance overlays

### Run the Marketing Website

```bash
cd web-app
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3001
```

- [ ] Safari Web Extension
- [ ] Standalone desktop application

## 🎯 Vision: The Future of Frontend Development Tools

Traditional development tools require context switching between your code and external dashboards. AI assistants can suggest improvements but can't provide real-time visual feedback.

**We're building tools that work alongside you as you develop**, providing:
- **Immediate visual feedback** directly on your running application
- **Real-time insights** that update as you interact with your UI
- **Framework-aware analysis** that understands your tech stack
- **Zero-friction workflow** with no context switching required

## 🤝 Contributing

We're building the future of frontend development tools! Here's how to get involved:

1. **Try the current demo** and provide feedback
2. **Report bugs** or suggest features via GitHub Issues
3. **Contribute code** - check out our [Development Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
4. **Share your ideas** for new development tools

### Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MalTarDesigns/frontend-devtools-hub.git
cd frontend-devtools-hub

# Install website dependencies
cd web-app && npm install

# Extension requires no build step - just load in Chrome
```
